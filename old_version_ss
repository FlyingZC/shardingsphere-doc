+It includes running instance information of database access object, with sub-nodes as the identifiers of the currently running instance, which is automatically generated at each startup using UUID. 
 
 The identifiers are temporary nodes, which are registered when instances are online and cleared when instances are offline. The registry center monitors the change of those nodes to govern the database access of running instances and other things.
